**Project Description:**

Your task is to implement the <u>FallDetection</u> class, which will perform certain actions (more info can be found in the docstring of the FallDetection class in <u>fall_detection.py</u>).

The class should be implemented using packages such as numpy, torch, and cv2 (which is needed for visualizations but not included in the class).

You are provided with all the requirements and a videos with skeletons in the ./__data__ folder (<u>video_i.mp4</u> and <u>skeletons_i.npy</u>).
__Please note__ that the skeletons.npy file may contain missing points, so you'll need to address this issue (it is common to fill missing points with NaNs or values less than or equal to 0).
